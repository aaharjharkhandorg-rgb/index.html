        <a href="https://aahar-jharkhand.org/" target="_blank">Aahar Jharkhand</a> is the official digital platform developed by the Department of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs, Government of Jharkhand. 
        It has been designed to bring transparency, efficiency, and accessibility to the state’s Public Distribution System (PDS). 
        By using this portal, citizens can manage ration card services, track allocation data, and check their eligibility for food security benefits under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013.

        The platform plays a crucial role in supporting households under categories like Priority Household (PHH) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY). 
        Families falling under these schemes receive subsidized food grains, including rice, wheat, and sugar. 
        PHH families are entitled to five kilograms per person each month, while AAY families receive thirty-five kilograms of food grains per household. 
        This structure ensures that food security reaches the poorest and most vulnerable communities across Jharkhand.

        Apart from beneficiary details, the portal provides allocation reports, dealer-level distribution records, and E-Aahar Patrika for complete transparency. 
        It also helps prevent duplication of ration cards and leakage in the supply chain. 
        Citizens benefit by accessing services online without long queues, while the government achieves better monitoring and accountability. 
        Overall, this initiative has modernized food grain distribution and stands as a strong example of digital governance.
