      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://aahar-jharkhand.org/" target="_blank">Aahar Jharkhand</a> is an official digital platform of the Government of Jharkhand that manages ration card services and ensures food security under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. 
        This portal provides citizens with transparent access to ration card details, allocation reports, and beneficiary records, all in one place. 
        It is a vital step towards improving the efficiency of the Public Distribution System (PDS) across the state.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Services</h2>
      <p>
        The portal offers multiple services, including ration card search and verification, monthly NFSA allocation reports, dealer-level records, and the E-Aahar Patrika for transparency. 
        Citizens can apply for new ration cards, update existing details, or check their eligibility online without visiting government offices. 
        By digitizing these processes, the government reduces paperwork, prevents duplication, and strengthens monitoring of food grain distribution.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits to Citizens</h2>
      <p>
        Aahar Jharkhand directly benefits families categorized under Priority Household (PHH) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY). 
        PHH families receive five kilograms of food grains per person per month, while AAY households are entitled to thirty-five kilograms monthly. 
        These benefits ensure that even the poorest families have reliable access to essential food items like rice, wheat, and sugar at subsidized prices. 
        The system has not only improved food access but has also built trust through transparency.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By combining technology with welfare, the portal has become a model of digital governance in Jharkhand. 
        It reduces corruption, increases efficiency, and ensures that every eligible family receives their rightful share of food grains. 
        With its user-friendly interface and reliable services, Aahar Jharkhand is a crucial initiative in the fight against hunger and malnutrition.
